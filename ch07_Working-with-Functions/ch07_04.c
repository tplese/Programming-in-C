/* Modify Program 7.8 so that the value of guess is printed each time through the while loop. Notice how quickly the value of guess converges to the square root.
 * What conclusions can you reach about
 * - the number of iterations through the loop,
 * - the number whose square root is being calculated, and
 * - the value of the initial guess?
 *
 * TP - I already did it in program ch07_03.c
